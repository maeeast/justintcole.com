           Mathematical Business Model

        <!-- Core Content -->
        <div class="content">
Below is a Mathematical Business Model created to generate predictions of subscriber-base, revenue, and profit for a service that required a physical product to use it. (circa 2007)</a>
<br />
Initially, this was three static charts similar to those found on the "Summary" and "Valuation" worksheets. I realized, as I was asked to update them often for differing scenarios, that I should build a means to do so quickly and easily. As a result, I made the initial charts dynamic so that the mathematics calculated based on the simple inputs.<br />
My employer expected a several-hour turnaround on each new simulation request. Automating the simple charts allowed me add new features with each pass. Eventually, I had a much more powerful tool and I was able to offer more insight, regarding changing scenarios, with a near-instantaneous turn-around time.<br />
To see the full potential of this tool you will need to download the <a href="JCole_MathModel.xlsx">full version</a> as the published version below is locked in its current state.
