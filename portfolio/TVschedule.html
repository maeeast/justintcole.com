           Proposed Schedule for SciFi Channel - 1 Year Cycle
        </div>
        <!-- Core Content -->
        <div class="content">
Below is a television programming schedule for the SciFi Channel (circa 2007)</a>
<br />
This was drafted when the SciFi Channel abandoned their core audience to seek a more lucrative programming model. The schedule below arose due to an online discussion where I was told that television programming choices are more difficult than they seem and I would not be able to do better than the choices the channel made. I assembled the below schedule in approximately one hour.<br />
If I had information on how much each of the syndicated shows listed, and the original content, cost to product and air I could have included that information. Additionally, I could, easily, have included an analysis of those costs in comparison to the expected advertising revenue for the shows during the listed time slots if that information was readily available.<br />
