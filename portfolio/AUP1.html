I.	PURPOSE

The purpose of this document is to set forth guidelines for usage of all technology equipment (including computers, cameras, video cameras, VCRs, TVs, DVD Players, etc.) that is owned by [THE DISTRICT] as well as any services (such as internet access or cable television channels) that are available. To ensure that all users have read and understand the policy each user must sign and return the last page of this policy (in the event that the user is a minor, the user and a legal guardian of the user must both sign) prior to being able to access any technology equipment in the district. A copy of the returned form shall be available upon request of the user or the user’s parent from the relevant school office. 

II.	GENERAL STATEMENT OF POLICY

In this policy a “user” is defined as one who makes use of the equipment or services available through [THE DISTRICT]. Users must read and sign this agreement before being able to make use of the equipment and/or services.
[THE DISTRICT] strives to provide the best computer facilities and equipment it can to its users. In addition, [THE DISTRICT] strives to provide adequate resources and training to accompany the facilities and equipment. Decisions made on what shall be permitted and what shall not be permitted are based on the educational usefulness of the task and the importance of knowing how to properly perform that task once our students have graduated.
It should be known that, although computer usage is a key part of today’s educational process, use of the school district’s equipment and services is a privilege and not a right. Different levels of this privilege can and will be revoked (from a time limited partial revocation to full revocation of all usage) for misuse (let it also be known that certain actions may carry additional corrective measures beyond revocation) at any time regardless of what work the user feels they need to accomplish on the equipment. In addition, users will be expected to repair or replace any equipment damaged by them through neglect or intentional abuse. Such misuse will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, as potential methods for misuse are too numerous to specifically outline. In the event that local, state or federal laws change in such a way to be more restrictive than this policy users should consider the new laws the binding operational procedure until a new EDC Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) can be generated and disseminated to the user-base.

III.	ACCEPTABLE USAGE 

[THE DISTRICT] recognizes the importance of access to technology in education to enhance the educational experience for the students and increase the amount of information that the students can learn. The following items are examples of permissible usage of the [THE DISTRICT] technology equipment and services. Additional activities may also be permitted assuming they serve to enhance the education of the students.

A.	Any piece of technology equipment or service available for or through [THE DISTRICT] can be used for academic reasons by its students or staff provided the content is of an acceptable nature (see below). This includes the usage of cable and/or satellite television channels and the Internet as a research tool as well as the physical equipment needed to view use materials.

B.	Any piece of technology equipment in [THE DISTRICT] can be used for any educational needs, services or programs as long as the viewed content is appropriate for a school environment.

IV.	UNACCEPTABLE USES

There are many ways access to technology equipment and services can be abused. While it is not possible to list all of these ways, below is a list of all actions that are always forbidden while using [THE DISTRICT] equipment or services. Actions not defined here may or may not be determined “unacceptable” if and when they occur.

A.	Any user who uses any piece of district equipment or a service to view,
store, access, transmit or create anything of a nature that is unacceptable for a school environment will face revocation of technology usage privileges as well as other disciplinary action.
     Unacceptable content includes, but is not limited to:
     1. Anything of a pornographic or sexually explicit nature
     2. Anything containing very specific instructions on how to cause substantial harm to an individual or group of individuals.
     3. Anything that has a sole purpose of propagating dislike based on race, color, gender, or any other affiliation (e.g. Hate Literature). 
     4. Anything containing excessive amounts of language not appropriate for speaking in a public environment.
     5. Anything that proves to have a disruptive affect on the educational process.
     6. Anything that is illegal.
     7. (For creation and transmission only) Making any material or likeness of a private individual public without the expressed permission of that individual.
     8. (For creation and transmission only) Anything that is designed to be threatening or intimidating to other individuals or small groups.

B.	Any user caught attempting to access information which is restricted for security or privacy reason will face disciplinary action (examples include hacking another user’s network directory or teacher’s grade book).

C.	Users will not attempt to access the school equipment or systems using any credentials other than the generic account or their individual account. Using the computer system without proper electronic credentials will be treated as vandalism. Users will properly log on and off computer terminals and use proper sign in and out procedures for all TV’s, VCR’s for every incidence of usage.

D.	Vandalism will be treated as such and is expanded to include not only deliberate alterations to hardware and/or system configurations but also deliberate introductions of computer viruses and other malicious computer code. Vandalism may result in a monetary fine to repair or replace the damaged equipment or pay for cleaning services to be rendered. 

E.	Users will not be permitted to use the equipment and/or services provided by [THE DISTRICT] for their own financial benefit, regardless of equipment location.

F.	Users will not use the technology equipment and services available within the district to violate any other school system policies and procedures (See [THE DISTRICT] Policy Book). 

G.	Users will not attempt to circumvent corrective measures put in place as a corrective action to prior AUP violations.

H.	Monitoring network activity for a purpose other than network management, authorized training activities or abuse investigations is prohibited.

I.	Users will refrain from any actions that cause excessive network activity without prior consent from the technical support department. (note: previous version had this line combined with item H.)             

J.	Users, by accepting this policy and the resulting usage of technology equipment, pledge to refrain from any copyright violations for any media they may desire to use. This includes, but is not limited to, music downloads, movie downloads, plagiarism, photocopying beyond permitted amounts, and software installations. 

By using [THE DISTRICT]’s equipment the user accepts total responsibility for any repercussions imposed for copyright violations they have performed (this could include lawsuits, large fines and possibly incarceration). [THE DISTRICT] will not defend any user for their copyright infringement choices.

In the event that a user inadvertently violates the unacceptable use areas they should immediately report the incident to someone of a higher or equal position in the chain of command of [THE DISTRICT] as well as the technology department. This immediate disclosure will serve against any allegation that the user has deliberately violated the policy and will provide the appropriate knowledge to prevent such accidental exposure in the future.

V.	NO EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY 

A.	Any service or equipment owned by the district directly or entrusted to the district’s care may, at any time, and without prior warning, be examined for content access and/or storage that violate this agreement. In the event that personally owned equipment is being on [THE DISTRICT] property by an individual user, such a search will be limited to checking files accessed while on school grounds, unless an allegation has been made requiring further examination. Users acknowledge and agree to the stipulation that by using their personal equipment within the district it could be searched completely and thoroughly in the event that an allegation requiring such a search is made. Users also agree that such a search of their personally owned equipment may be made with justification. Such a search will only be conducted if school authorities have a reasonable suspicion that the search will uncover a violation of law or school district policy or in an attempt to disprove an allegation of inappropriate content.

B.	Students of [THE DISTRICT] can expect no privacy of their files. Parents and appropriate staff have the right at any time to investigate or review the contents of any student’s files.

C.	Parents have the right to request the termination of their child’s individual technology usage account at any time. Termination of any account may include deletion of account and all files associated with only that account. Future recovery of these files may not be possible, and the district accepts no responsibility for the loss of such files due to account de-activation.

D.	The school district will cooperate fully with local, state and federal authorities in any investigation concerning or related to any illegal activities and activities not in compliance with school district policies conducted through the school district system.

E.	Investigations of content and network traffic may be done on equipment other than an individual computer. These investigations may include IP address logging, packet traces and any other network management tools are (or become) available to [THE DISTRICT] staff.

F.	Services and accounts provided by the district at no cost to the user are publicly funded and are therefore public knowledge per the Freedom of Information Act. The contents of individual user storage accounts will not be disseminated to the public without due legal cause, however the knowledge of the account existing should be considered publicly known. As with district phone numbers, the district provided email addresses will be made publicly known via the district web page and email directory services (when available). Unless otherwise specified by the user’s supervisor, the user has the choice to not check that email, however this may cause the user to miss important notifications and notices disseminated solely over email. Any harassment and/or threatening inward bound messages will be dealt with using available technical and legal solutions. 

VI.	LIMITATION ON SCHOOL DISTRICT LIABILITY

Use of the school district system is at the user’s own risk. The system is provided on an “as is, as available” basis. 

A.	The school district will not be responsible for any damage users may suffer, including, but not limited to, loss, damage or unavailability of data stored on school district diskettes, tapes, hard drives or servers, or for delays or changes in or interruptions of service or misdelivery or delivery failures of information or materials, regardless of the cause. 

B.	The school district is not responsible for the accuracy or quality of any advice or information obtained through or stored on the school district system. 

C.	The school district will not be responsible for financial obligations arising from the use of the school district system or the Internet, unless prior arrangements have been made with the appropriate personnel.

VII.	USER NOTIFICATION

All users shall be notified of the policies involving usage of technology equipment and services within the district. 
Such notification is assumed complete upon the return of the signed last page of this document. No user may be considered an authorized user until this form is completed and returned.
While every effort has been made and will continue to be made to protect the children in the care of [THE DISTRICT], it is possible for users to access inappropriate content. When this occurs, disciplinary action will occur which will include a form of revocation of technology privileges. Let it be known that when such a revocation occurs the measures implemented are not foolproof and it is possible that a user may devise a method for circumventing those methods. Such measures will result in additional revocations of technology privileges.

All provisions of the acceptable use policy are subordinate to local, state and federal laws. 

VIII.	PARENT RESPONSIBILITY; NOTIFICATION OF STUDENT INTERNET USE

Outside of school, parents bear the same responsibility and guidance as required by school personnel. Parents are expected to be responsible for monitoring the use of any technology equipment or service when the student is not actively participating in a school function or regular school day. This responsibility extends to include usage of the internet as well as any remote accessing of the school network. This responsibility is compounded if the student is using equipment that is either owned by the district or has been entrusted to the district’s care to include proper care and maintenance of the equipment when not on school grounds.

Other supervisors bear the same responsibility as teachers when accompanying  minors that are using the district’s technology equipment.

By returning the signed form, parents acknowledge that their children will be using the Internet and that the children have the permission of the parents to do so. 

IX.	IMPLEMENTATION; POLICY REVIEW 

Implementation and enforcement of this policy will be dealt with as needed by the appropriate school officials. Every attempt will be made to make any corrective action proven necessary as fair as possible. In every corrective event, the Technical Coordinator, the school Principal and the staff member reporting the incident will all be informed of the event with the possibility of other staff members being informed as needed. The Technical Coordinator will make a recommendation on what technical action will best prevent further violations. The Principal will make the final decision on the corrective action (which may or may not differ substantially from the Technical Coordinator’s recommendation).

The Technology Committee shall determine each year, through direct review if this document needs revision. In the case that such revision is deemed necessary it will be made and presented to the Board of Directors of [THE DISTRICT] for implementation the following year. In addition to the [THE DISTRICT] EDC Technology Acceptable Use Policy, other policies may be referenced regarding technology usage. Examples of such reference may be, but not limited to: EBCC Bomb Threats; IHBAH Disciplinary Removal of Students with Disabilities; ILD Educational Research of Student Surveys, Analysis. Or Evaluations; JB Student Educational Opportunities; JK Student Discipline; JRA, JRA-E, JRA-R Access Rights to Student Records; KHA Public Solicitation in the Schools, KHB Advertising in the Schools, KHC Distribution, Posting of Promotional Material; Curriculum Development; Instructional Curriculum; Textbooks and Instructional Material; Vandalism.

It is recommended that any questions regarding the operation of [THE DISTRICT] should be researched in the [THE DISTRICT] Policy Book.

PARENT OR GUARDIAN

As the parent or guardian of this student, I have read the school district policies regarding technology usage in [THE DISTRICT]. I understand that this policy includes usage of all technological devices and services, including, but not limited to, the Television Sets, DVD Players, VCRs, all computer equipment and the Internet. I understand that this access is designed for educational purposes; however, I also recognize it is impossible for the school district to restrict access to all controversial materials and I will not hold the school district or its employees or agents responsible for materials acquired on the Internet or through other, un-official means. I hereby give permission to issue an account for my child and certify that the information provided on this form is correct.

Parent or Guardian’s Name (please print): _______________________________________

Parent or Guardian’s Signature: _______________________________________

SUPERVISING (Homeroom) TEACHER

I have read the school district policies relating to acceptable use of the school district computer system and the Internet and agree to promote these policies with the student. Because the student may use the Internet on the school district computer system for individual work or in the context of another class, I cannot be held responsible for the student use of the Internet or district network. As the supervising teacher I do agree to instruct the student on acceptable use of the Internet and district network and proper network etiquette, and I have reviewed this policy with my students.

General note: it is speculated that several of the student-based AUP violations that have occurred this school year were through ignorance of what items were and were not allowed because the students had trouble understanding the legal language of the policy they signed. It is with this in mind that I recommend we paste the following text as its own page either immediately preceding or immediately after the signature page or that we hand it out as an AUP cover sheet (so as to not have it be an official part of the AUP document). If there are questions, comments or concerns about this, please feel free to make edits on the text or contact me for additional input. If such an addition is a violation of standard MSAD 63 practices then, by all means, feel free to retract it (and this paragraph) from this document. 
</h6></i>
General AUP guidelines of operation (written for the students’ ease of comprehension):
1.	If the task you are trying to do is not directly related to schoolwork, do not do it.
2.	If, for some reason, the task you are trying to do appears to be blocked or otherwise hindered, do not proceed without direct permission of a teacher or administrator.
3.	If you are unsure about any task you wish to perform, as first. Asking about something will not get you in trouble, but being caught violating this policy will get you in trouble.
