Notes on resume improvements:
Drop down menu that allows user to select from a series of pre-made resumes to view OR "custom"
Custom will generate more drop-down menus. One will be a date range. One will be for experience type (professional, theatre, other, all). One will be for role type (project manager, BA, sales, sales engineer, customer service, technical support, etc, all). One will be for format (reverse chronological, skills-based, achievements-based, etc). Once the items are set and the "Build it!" buttons is clicked a resume will be compiled based on the chosen options and displayed. An "export" button will be presented that allows the resulting resume to be printed out as a PDF.
