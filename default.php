The purpose of this site is to practice my own development skills.
<br><Br>
It will evolve from this blank slate to a fully-developed personal website.

<!-- I plan to put a header which is a panoramic sunset photo from my home.
The menu will be down the left.
I plan to have a section for summary of me, a section to outline a bit about the menagerie I care for, my professional career (which will be an interactive resume thatis built on a database of my experience and a work sample archive), my writing (some samples), and some other hobbies
