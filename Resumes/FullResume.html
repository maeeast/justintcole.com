          SUMMARY
     </div>
<p>I am an ambitious self-starter who excels at solving problems. Being adaptable and analytical compose the very foundation of my career. These two traits have brought me success in every situation and drove solutions to the large-scale problems I have faced. I have developed and implemented revisions to the entire scope of IT Department strategies and budgets as well as created plans to dramatically improve performance of operations. I am well-equipped to handle rapidly changing, fast-paced environments. I have always been a quick learner who is able to absorb new environments, skills, and technical information quickly.</p>
