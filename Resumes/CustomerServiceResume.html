          SUMMARY
     </div>
          I have a proven track record of managing important concerns relating to technology products that spans more than 15 years. My previous successes in resolving problems and providing excellent service is rooted in my ability to readily assess a situation and determine the root cause rather than merely treating the manifested symptom. In addition to my record of properly identifying concerns for resolution, I have also accumulated a reputation for exceeding expectations in work volume.
